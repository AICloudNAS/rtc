To get started with `rtc.js` the first thing you should do is get a copy of the library.  This can be done in any of the following ways:

- By installing it from npm:

  ```
  npm install rtc --save
  ```

- By installing it with bower:

  ```
  bower install rtc
  ```

__NOTE:__ I would strongly recommend using NPM for your managing your application dependencies.
